emh128_1 password: cisVwAWJRLtbTjGdJLYDxnlooOcT

approach:

My first thought was to use the mystrings program that I had just written. After dumping all printable strings,
i did a keyword search on "Sorry! Not correct!". This brought me to a block that said

cisVwAWJRLtbTjGdJLYDxnlooOcT
Sorry! Not correct!
Congratulations!
Unlocked with passphrase %s

After that, I tried the code at the top of the block, and it worked.



emh128_2 password: Palindrome >= 8 characters

approach:

First, I set a breakpoint in main. After disas, I saw that there were calls to c, p, and s from the main function.
I set breakpoints for each function call (b c, b p, b s). I set a breakpoint in c and found that my string is in %ebx.
Also, <s> gets called inside of c 3 times in order to check the length of the input. I knew this because s loops string
length + 1 times. After the length is verified as over 8 in length (%eax >= 8), c gets ride of the new line terminator.
P is called inside of c to make sure that the string is a palindrome.
